#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#1191, it is recommended to not commit Pipfile.lock if it is a deployment.
#   Instead, pipenv install --dev should be used to install dependencies.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, for applications, you might want to ignore it if you prefer to always use the latest compatible versions.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
